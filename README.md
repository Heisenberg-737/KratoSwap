## A NFT Trading Platform using AMMs

NFT Trading Platform using Automated Market Makers is a DEX protocol that enables trading of NFTs on Ethereum Blockchain

## Objectives
- As an NFT AMM protocol, the project works by letting Liquidity Providers deposit NFTs and/or ETH into liquidity pools.
- The users can choose to either buy or sell NFTs (or both), deposit your NFTs and/or ETH, and then indicate a starting price and percentage of price fluctuation.
- Will be using suitable pricing mechanism to algorithmically set the relationship between price and supply.
- Now users can trade NFTs from the pool and earn trading fees as people trade from the pool. Every time an NFT is bought or sold, the price of another NFT algorithmically changes for the pool, based on the bonding curve. Users can choose to switch the pool parameters or withdraw assets at any time.
- Since there are as many pools as there are LPs, users can search through the different pools to find their desired NFT at their preferred price.
